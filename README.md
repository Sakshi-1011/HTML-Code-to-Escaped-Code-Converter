# HTML-Code-to-Escaped-Code-Converter
# 🔄 HTML Code to Escaped Code Converter

A lightweight web tool that converts raw HTML code into escaped HTML entities, allowing you to safely display code examples in tutorials, blogs, or documentation without the browser rendering them.

## 💡 Why Use This?

Displaying raw HTML code on a webpage can be tricky, as browsers try to interpret and render it. This tool solves that by converting characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, and `&` into their HTML-safe versions (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&amp;`), making your code visible and readable.
